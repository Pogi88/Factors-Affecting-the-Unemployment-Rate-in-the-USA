# ðŸ“‰ Factors Affecting the Unemployment Rate in the USA

## ðŸ›  Project Overview:

This project delves into a multivariate time series analysis to identify and analyze the key factors affecting the unemployment rate in the United States from Q1 1980 to Q4 2022. The analysis uses various economic indicators and statistical techniques to uncover trends, structural breaks, and the underlying relationships between the unemployment rate and other economic variables.

This is a group project we created together with Anna Fischer.

## ðŸš€ Key Components:

### Data Collection and Preparation:

- Data sourced from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API.
- Quarterly data from 1980 to 2022 for variables including real GDP, inflation (CPI), interest rates, and productivity.
- Data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation into a structured time series format.
  
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- Visualized trends in the unemployment rate, real GDP, inflation, interest rates, and productivity.
- Differencing applied to time series data to stabilize variances and remove trends.
  
### Stationarity Testing and Differencing:

- Performed stationarity tests (ADF, PP, KPSS) to ensure that the time series data was stationary.
- Applied differencing where necessary to achieve stationarity and prepared the data for further analysis.
  
### Structural Break Analysis:

- Conducted structural break tests (QLR, BP, and CUSUM) on each variable to identify significant changes in trends over time.
- Detected multiple structural breaks in variables like GDP, inflation, interest rates, productivity, and unemployment, indicating major shifts in the economic environment.
  
### Modeling and Forecasting:

- Used advanced statistical models to analyze the relationships between unemployment and other economic factors.
- Identified the periods where major economic shifts occurred and how these influenced the unemployment rate.
  
### Interpretation of Results:

- Comprehensive interpretation of the impact of macroeconomic factors on the unemployment rate.
- Key findings highlighted the sensitivity of the unemployment rate to changes in economic growth, inflation, interest rates, and productivity over different periods.
